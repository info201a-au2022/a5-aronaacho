This data was visualised as a scatter plot for easier understanding of how these emissions have changed over time. It is notable that there was a rapid increase in carbon emissions until the end of the 2000s, leading to a decline in emissions until the mid 2010s. Towards the end of the 2010s, there has been a slight increase in emissions, but not to the extent of the increase that happened in the 1990s. While both the trade emissions in million tonnes and as a percentage of production-based emissions follow similar trends, the percentage trendline is comparatively softer then the one shown in million tonnes, perhaps due to an increase in production-based emissions from sources other than trade emerging in the 21st century.")
